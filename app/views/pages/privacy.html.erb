  <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p>Welcome to Billss, a service operated by Billss Limited (“Billss”, “us”, “our”,  or “we”).   We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the information we collect from users of our products and services (“Services”).
  </p>

  <p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></p>

  <p><strong><u>Personal Information</u></strong>.  We collect Personal Information from you when you register for our Services, as well as when you provide us with any such Personal Information (e.g., when responding to a survey or filling out a form).  When registering for our Services, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and/or additional information that could be used (whether alone or in combination with additional information) to identify you personally (“Personal Information”). It may be possible for you to use certain of our Services (or certain features of our Services) anonymously; but, if you do not register for the Services, you may not be able to access certain features or functions of the Services.</p>

  <p><i>Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites</i></p>

  <p>We created interfaces that allow you to connect your account for our Services with accounts you may have established with third-party apps, messaging platforms and other services (“Third-Party Services”). These interfaces allow you to authorise us to access your account on a Third-Party Service on your behalf.  In order to provide this authorisation, you do not provide us with credentials for the Third-Party Service, but you will need to log-in to that Third-Party Service directly through us.  Once authorised by you, the Third-Party Service recognises us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information.  You should be able to revoke our access to any Third-Party Service at any time by changing the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable Third-Party Service.</p>

  <p><strong><u>Anonymous Information.</strong></u></p>

  <p>We collect the following types of “Anonymous Information”:</p>

  <p>Information Collected by Our Servers. As is true of most online services, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including but not limited to information regarding the device and/or software program through which you access our Services (e.g., the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, phone number, and mobile network information), and/or a date/time stamp for your use of our Services. We use this information to analyse trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of this information may be collected so that when you use the Services again, we will recognize you and provide information and other materials appropriate to your interests.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What do we use your information for?</strong></p>

  <p>The Personal Information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>To improve our Services – we continually strive to improve our Services based on the information and feedback we receive from you;</li>
    <li>To improve customer service – your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs;</li>
    <li>To market to you our products and services (and those of third parties) that we believe may interest you, and to permit third parties to market such products and services to you;</li>
    <li>To tailor the content and features of the Services to you;</li>
    <li>To improve the quality of the Services;</li>
    <li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other feature; and</li>
    <li>To send periodic emails.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</p>

  </p>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</p>

  <p>We disclose certain Personal Information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>To third parties to whom you ask us to disclose Personal Information;</li>
    <li>To third party vendors who help us provide the Services ;</li>
    <li>To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy;</li>
    <li>In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy; and</li>
    <li>If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Use Agreement; (b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity, in which case we can (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Our Services may enable you to share content and/or information between our Service and Third-Party Services.  If you choose to do this, we will provide such content and/or information to such Third-Party Services in accordance with your elections. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those Third-Party Services and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the Third-Party Services. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services; (ii) the content, products or services of such Third-Party Services; or (iii) your use of any such Third-Party Services.
  </p>

  <p>We reserve the right to disclose Anonymous Information publicly without restriction.</p>

  <p><strong>Third-party links</strong></p>

  <p>
    At our discretion we may occasionally reference, include or offer third-party products or services via our Services. These third-party products and services are offered by third parties that have separate and independent privacy policies. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should read and understand their privacy policies. We have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these third parties.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Your Choices Regarding Your Information</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><u>Mobile Device.</u> Certain features of the Services may require access to your device’s location functionality and/or media storage and contacts applications. Although you may decide whether or not to use these features, on Android devices you grant us permission to access this feature as part of registering for the Service. If you later decide to revoke this permission, you can do so by making such elections from directly within the Service. Alternatively, on iOS devices, you can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to these features or functions by changing the settings on your device.</li>
    <li><u>Communications</u>. We may periodically send you communications that directly promote the use of our Services. When you receive promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us. You will have the opportunity to “opt-out” of receiving promotional e-mails from us by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you Service-related communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use Agreement or this Privacy Policy, which you may not opt out of receiving.</li>
    <li><u>Changing or Deleting Your Personal Information.</u> You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your account by contacting us. If you completely delete all of your Personal Information, then your account may become deactivated, although your profile and any content associated therewith will remain on the Services unless you have deleted them. We may also retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to which we have made those disclosures. Certain information is necessary in order for us to provide the Services; therefore, if you delete such necessary information you may not be able to use the Services.</li>
  </ul>


  <p><strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</strong></p>

  <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and children under 13 are not eligible to use our Services.  Our Services are directed to individuals who are at least 18 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from individuals we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Services is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Services.</p>



  <strong><p>A Note to Users</p></strong>

  <p>By providing us with information to or through the Services, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your information, you consent to such transfer.</p>

  <p><strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong></p>

  If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

  <p><strong>Contacting Us</strong></p>

  <p>If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy, or any Services provided by us, please contact us at Billss Limited, at <strong><span style="color: #6112FE;">hello@billss.co</span></strong>.</p>
